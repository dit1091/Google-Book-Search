# Google-Book-Search

This application can be used to Google search and view books. The App includes React components, works with helper/util functions, and utilizes React lifecycle methods to query and display books based on user searches. It also uses Node, Express and MongoDB so that users can save books to review or purchase later.

Users can search for books via the Google Books API and render them here. Users have the option to "View" a book, bringing them to the book on Google Books, or "Save" a book, saving it to the Mongo database. In addition, the app renders all books saved to the Mongo database. The user also has an option to "Delete" a book, removing it from the Mongo database.
